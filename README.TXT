Welcome to Arena!

Arena is coded in Python, using the Pygame library.

Pygame depends on SDL. Do not run on Mac OS, as SDL has a bug with Mac OS, and the images will appear distorted.

Recommend Linux, as installing is difficult on Windows.

For Ubuntu (Linux):
sudo apt-get SDL
pip install pygame

Note: This game is coded for 1280 by 800 resolution. Window size can not be changed, as if it were changed,
locations of HUD would be in incorrect places.
